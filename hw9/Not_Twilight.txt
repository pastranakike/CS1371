CHAPTER I 

A COUPLE of years ago, on the very verge of the ill- 
ness that subsequently overwhelmed me, I took a 
small furnished house in Pineland. I made no in- 
spection of the place, bu21321321t signed the agreement at 
the instance of the local house-agent, who proved 
little less inventive than the majority of his con- 
freres. 

Three months of neuritis, only kept within 
bounds by drugs, had made me comparatively indif- 
ferent to my surroundings. It was necessary for 
me to move because I had become intolerant of the 
friends who exclaimed at my ill looks, and the 65121.
acquaintances who failed to notice any alteration 
in me. One sister whom I really loved, and who 
really loved me, exasperated me by constant visits 
and ill-concealed anxiety. Another irritated me 
little less by making light of my ailment and speak- 
ing of neuritis in an easy fami?@!#$%^&567567liar manner as one 
might of toothache or a corn. I had no natural 
sleep, and if I were not on the borderland of in- 
sanity, I was at least within sight of the home park 
of inconsequence. Reasoned behaviour was no 
longer possible, and I knew it was necessary for me 
to be alone.
