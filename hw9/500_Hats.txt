IN THE beginning, Bartholomew Cubbins didn’t have five hundred hats. 
He had only one hat. It was an old one that had belonged to his father and 
his father’s father before him. It was probably the oldest and the plainest hat 
in the whole Kingdom of Didd, where Bartholomew Cubbins lived. But 
Bartholomew liked it — especially because of the feather that always pointed 
straight up in the air. 



The Kingdom of Didd was ruled by King 
Derwin. His palace stood high on the top of the 
mountain. From his balcony, he looked down over 
the houses of all his subjects — first, over the spires 
of the noblemen’s castles, across the broad roofs 
of the rich men’s mansions, then over the little 
houses of the townsfolk, to the huts of the farmers 
far off in the fields. 

It was a mighty view and it made King Derwin 
feel mighty important. 





Far off in the fields, on the edge of a cranberry bog, stood the hut of the Cubbins family. From the small door 
Bartholomew looked across the huts of the farmers to the houses of the townsfolk, then to the rich men’s mansions and 
the noblemen’s castles, up to the great towering palace of the King. It was exactly the same view that King Derwin saw 
from his balcony, but Bartholomew saw it backward. 

It was a mighty view, but it made Bartholomew Cubbins feel mighty small.
