Antigone 



[Antigone and Ismene enter] 
Antigone 

Ismene, my own sister by blood, 
Do you see how Zeus fulfills in us 
While we live the woes of Oedipus? 
There is no pain, no affliction, no shame 
Nor dishonour that is not present 
Among your suffering and mine. 



And what of this new proclamation

DW Myatt - Sophocles, Antogone 



Sophocles: Antigone 



By the General to all the people? 
Have you heard - and know what it means? 
Or do you not understand how the suffering 
Of our foe now comes to our clan? 

Ismene 

I have heard of nothing told of our folk, Antigone, 
Whether grievous or good since we two 
Lost our two brothers killed in one day 

leir own two hands. 
And since the Argive army fled this same night 
have heard nothing to give me more sorrow or joy. 




rone 

Such was my thought and thus I summoned you 

id the courtyard gate so only you can hear this. 

Ismene 

What is it? For I see you colour changed, 
rone 



It is that Creon has given burial honour 

only one of our brothers, leaving the other dishonoured 
Eteocles, it is reported, has with rightful justice 



Sophocles: Antigone 



the dead below. But pitiful is the death of Polynices 
For by royal decree no one may cover him, 

lent his death or weep 
But must leave him unburied as a welcome feast 

carrion birds to eat as they will. 
Such, they say, is the proclamation of Creon "the noble" 

>r you and me. For me! And soon shall he be here 
To proclaim this directly to those who have not heard. 

does not hold this as of no worth 
Since whosoever disobeys the edict 

by a public stoning in the citadel - be murdered! 

Thus things are - and now you shall swiftly show 
you are noble or will debase the race that gave you birth! 





But what, my grieving sister, can I do 
To loosen or make the knot? 

Antigone 

Will you work with me to do the deed? 



To attempt what? Where is your thought leading?

He is mine, as yours - though you wish he was not:

rone 



He cannot keep me from my own! 



/e thought, sister, of how our father, 
Dishonoured and abhorred, was destroyed: 

convicted himself of wrong and by his own hands 
With his own act struck out both his eyes. 

m his mother and wife - two names for one - 
With a coiled rope made a failure of her life.

third - our two brothers in one day 
Slaughtered themselves when their own hands 
raised each against their kin. 

Consider now that we alone remain - 
Pitifully shall we perish if we defy the decree 
60 Or the power of our King. 

lect that we are women, not disposed 
By our nature to strive against men - 
For the stronger rule, and therefore we should listen 
To such orders, and those that are worse. 
I thus ask the pardon of those below 
Since in these things I have no power 
md must therefore obey those in authority. 
To be excessive is unwise. 



itigone 

more shall I exhort you, and even if another day 
You wished it, I would not welcome your sharing 

deed! Be as you are; as for me, I shall bury him 
Since it is beautiful to die doing such a thing: 

mil lie by he whom I love who loves me, 
I - the villain sanctioned by the gods. For I have 
>re seasons to spend pleasing those below

What the gods themselves honour.

And cannot act against the folk.

If you must - then do not announce the deed 
But keep it secret, as I shall.

A hot heart you have for cold things.

I appease those whom it is necessary to please. 



Indeed, if it can be done - but your desire is impossible.

begin a hopeless guest is not cunning. 



Do not speak so, or you will become my foe 
then, justly, the lasting foe of the dead. 
Now leave me to my 'mistaken' counsel 
I shall suffer nothing as terrible

who love you will love you still.
