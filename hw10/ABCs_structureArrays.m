% ABCs of Structure Arrays
%
% Directions:
% Write the code to satisify the following directions. For each part, store
% your answer in the variable that is specified within the parantheses. 
%   Ex. Add 1 + 1. (GT)
% That means store the value of 1 + 1 in the variable GT. 
%
% Given Input Variables:
% Part I:
%   1. st1 - A structure with the same fields as str2 and str3
%   2. st2 - A structure with the same fields as str1 and str3 
%   3. st3 - A structure with the same fields as str1 and str2
%   4. sa1 - A structure array with the fields 'college' and 'state'
% Part II:
%   1. sa2 - A structure array with any number of fields (social media)
%
% st1, st2, and st3 could look like the following:
%   st1 = struct('field1', value1, 'field2', value2);
%   st2 = struct('field1', value3, 'field2', value4);
%   st3 = struct('field1', value5, 'field2', value6);

%% Part I: Short Coding & Conceptual
% 1. Creating structure arrays manually. st1, st2, and st3 are three
%    similar structures (similar means they have the same fields). Create a 
%    structure array of length three containing st3, st2, and st1 in that 
%    order. (A)
%    Hint: Structure Concatenation.
A = NaN;

% 2. Adding elements to a structure array. sa1 is a structure array. Two 
%    of its fields are 'college' and 'state'. Add another structure to the 
%    end of the array by setting the value of the 'college' field to 
%    'UCLA'. (B)
%    Hint: First alter sa1 then assign the value to B. Indexing with 
%          (end+1) may be be helpful.
B = NaN;

% 3. What value will be given when sa1(end).state is called? Assign what 
%    the value would be to (C).
C = NaN;

% 4. Create a structure array of length three with the fields: 'make', 
%    'model', and 'color'. The field values for each of the three
%    structures should be as follows:
%
%   1)  make: 'Honda'   model: 'Accord'   color: 'silver'
%   2)  make: 'BMW'     model: '335i'     color: 'silver'
%   3)  make: 'Volvo'   model: 'C70'      color: 'silver'
%
% Note: You *MUST* use struct() for this problem. (D)
D = NaN;

% 5. Make a (1xN) cell array where each cell contains each college name
%    from the 'college' field from sa1. Do not use iteration. (E)
%    Hint: Consider how you can combine using structure indexing and the 
%          curly brackets {}.
E = NaN;

%% Part II: Long Coding

% Directions: 
% Open and read through the file "ABCs_structureArraysPractice.pdf". The 
% file contains an example drill problem, which we are going to solve 
% together. Follow the directions and write your code to satisfy the 
% instructions. *DO NOT* uncomment any of the already commented lines
% below.

% function [J] = socialMedia(sa2)
% 1. Get out all of the social medias (field names) in sa2 and store them 
%    in (F).
F = NaN;

% 2. Initialize (G) as an empty array and then write a for loop to go
%    through each of the field names stored in G. At each iteration of the
%    for loop, make a vector (vec) of length N (same length as the 
%    structure array) with all of the hours for that particular social 
%    media. Then vertically concatenate vec onto G (vec below G).
%    Hint: to make a vector with all of the hours, use: 
%          vec = [sa2.<fieldname>]
G = NaN;
for ?

    
    G = NaN;
end

% 3. Sum the values in G row-wise (2nd array dimension). Store this column
%    vector in (H).
H = NaN;

% 4. Use the max function to find which index of H has the largest value
%    (most number of total hours). Store this index in (I).
I = NaN

% 5. Finally, use I to output the social media that you are most addicted
%    to (most total hours spent on) as a string. (J)
J = NaN;

% end
